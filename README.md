# My-Blog

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to create a personal blog post that we could continually update with new posts. In order to achieve this, we were required to send  post data gathered via form into our local storage, then pull that storage from a second web page and display it as a new post. We were also required to create a button to switch the theme of our website between light and dark mode, and a second button on our blog page to direct a user back to the originl form page.

## Usage

This webpage can be used to add new posts to a blog to a blog site. You may use the link below to a username, title, and post content. Once you submit the data, you will be direcrted to a second page where the data will be pulled from the local storage and displayed as a new post with its own section. You may also use the "back" button to navigate back to the form page, or the "light"  button to switch the pages theme between light and dark.
